# About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is Domi! I'm learning frontend developement and graphic design.
I'd love to find a job (or a traineeship) as a frontend dev.
Iâ€™m currently learning Angular, and oh boi, it ain't easy. I probably should have started with React. So next in line is React and Bootstrap.
It would be cool to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects :D
