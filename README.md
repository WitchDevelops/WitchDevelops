# What am I building now
I'm ~~currently working on two projects~~, one is a home page for local business, the other is a gallery with art by a friend of mine.
1) Massage studio caled "MasaÅ¼ Mistrza" - project repo [massage studio in Warsaw](https://github.com/WitchDevelops/Massage-studio-masaz-mistrza)
2) Art gallery by Sofia Banchenko - project repo [modern art by Sofia Banchenko](https://github.com/WitchDevelops/Artgallery-Sofiadali)

These've been put on hold, as I'm working on a homepage for our startup: SYNTRO.
