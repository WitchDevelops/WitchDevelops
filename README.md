👋 Hi, this is Domi! I'm learning frontend developement and graphic design.

👀 I’m interested in many things, especially life sciences and high fantasy. I'm also VERY interested in finding a job (or a traineeship) as a frontend dev.

🌱 I’m currently learning Angular, and oh boi, it ain't easy. I probably should have started with React. So next in line is React and Bootstrap.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects :D

📫 Reach me here:
    mail: domi@mokosh.dev
    discord: Domi#3442
    
# Portfolio
[mokosh.dev](mokosh.dev)
Any input will be highly appreciated!

(I know, it's currently build with a drag&drop service, I'm treating it more like an interactive mockup ;) I'll code my portfolio page once I'm 100% sure how I want it to look like and what to include.
